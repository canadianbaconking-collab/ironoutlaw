# UX Tuning Notes (v0.1)

## Toasts
- Show controls first: movement, then nitro/jump, then scoring concepts
- Toast duration: 2x current
- Toast spacing: +50% current
- Prefer time-based triggers with fallback thresholds

## Physics Feel
- Less twitch at high speed (steering scales down with speed)
- Cap max speed
- Nitro = capped accel boost (not huge impulses)
- Jump = short hop
